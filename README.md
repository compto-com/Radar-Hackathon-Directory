## The JS Library

https://github.com/compto-com/comptoken.js

Do you want to interact with the Comptoken Program on Solana? It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.  
Use this library for the heavy lifting of constructing, serializing, and sending requests to the Comptoken Program.

## The Token Program

https://github.com/compto-com/comptoken-program

Built on Solana, and currently deployed on Solana devnet. This is where the action happens. Comptoken-program handles the mining verification, minting, and distribution of comptokens, as interest and universal basic income. It implements the novel price stabilizing economic control system described in the Compto Open Money Protocol whitepaper. [compto.com/whitepaper](https://compto.com/whitepaper)

## The Mining Pool

https://github.com/compto-com/comptoken-mining-pool

Stratum mining pool built off of [public-pool](https://github.com/benjamin-wilson/public-pool). This allows bitcoin miners to direct their hashing power to mine comptokens. The mining pool does all the heavy lifting! Just point your miner to `stratum+tcp://compto.com:3333`, give your solana wallet address as your username, and we handle the rest!
